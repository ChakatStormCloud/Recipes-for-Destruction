Conservation of Mass:
It's something we all learned in chemistry, so why can't creepers obey it?

I decided to make this mod to make explosions a little more logical, and a little more fair.

When something get broken by an explosion, SOMETHING, will always drop, be it all the dirt that made up your farm... or the broken splinters of your fence.

Mining with explosions will also be more useful! Though be warned, some pieces of what ever you were mining might be a liiiittle too small to find.
